Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

Project Overview
The art of forecasting stock prices has always been a challenging task for researchers, analysts, and investors.  
This project aims to build a Stock Price Prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). 

By analyzing past stock market data, the model predicts future stock prices, helping investors and analysts make better decisions.  

Features
- Uses Nifty50 Stock Market Data (Kaggle dataset)
- Preprocessing with MinMaxScaler
- Sequence generation for time series forecasting
- Built with LSTM model
- Evaluation using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - RÂ² Score (Accuracy)
- Visualization of Actual vs Predicted Prices
